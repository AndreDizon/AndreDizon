          Hello! My name is Christian Andre R. Dizon. I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for technology and a love for innovation. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching or streaming movies, and listening to a wide range of music, but I like alternative rnb the most. My favorite food is adobo, a classic Filipino dish.
        </p>
        <p>
          In five years, I see myself as a proficient full-stack developer, creating impactful applications and contributing to innovative projects. I hope to have gained significant experience in the tech industry and to be in a position where I can mentor others.
